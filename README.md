A visualization of the exported logbook Kaya provides. 

# How to use 
1. On the Kaya app, go to your profile, hit the three dots and click "Export Logbook Via Email". 
2. Download your logbook CSV file from the email that is sent by Kaya. 
3. Copy paste the contents of the file into the "export.csv" file in this Jupyter notebook. Or, just delete mine and add yours (and update the name in the Juptyer notebook): whatever is easiest! 
4. Run the Juptyer notebook to get a sense of your progress from 2021 to 2022! :)
